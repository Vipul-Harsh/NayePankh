      <h2>How It Started</h2>
      <p>
        As we all know, 2020 was a year the world was striving to survive the
        global pandemic of covid-19. During these dire times we felt an urge to
        make an impact with whatever we had, and so we tried!! We tried to
        uplift the underprivileged and help the needy with all our resources and
        material we could arrange, it was tough but we didn't lose our hope and
        kept going in order to bring a change everyone was expecting the bigger
        authorities to bring in the societies on smaller levels. We started off
        as a group of bunch of highschoolers but now are a team of numerous
        people from different parts of the city and state! 28th March 2021, the
        day we officially landed on the ground to serve our duties as the youth
        of the most rapidly progressing nation afterall, the main hope of a
        nation lies in the arms of its youth.

      <h2>What is NayePankh?</h2>
      <p>
        Nayepankh foundation was initiated to bring a change and help people
        during the tough times of Covid. Later in the year, the NGO started to
        expand their operations and provide help to a wider section of the
        society. With this revamped vision, the NGO acquired the name of
        NayePankh – giving wings to uplift the underprivileged section of our
        society. NayePankh is one of the eminent NGOs espoused in providing
        food, sanitary napkins, clothes, educating underprivileged sectors of
        our society for the better future. We make efforts to solve daily
        problems faced by people of India. Most of the young women feel
        humiliating in public places during their menstrual cycle; to bring
        change we create awareness campaigns among woman and youths about
        personal hygiene, providing sanitary napkins. Also, in our endeavour to
        fight hunger we distribute food not only to the underprivileged
        community but also to the stray animals. We are also providing clothes
        to the poor families. Till date we have helped more than two lakhs of
        people. Although this seems quite a big achievement, but our goal is
        still not complete, therefore we’re continuing more with hustle. When
        lockdown was hitting hard, we took a decision and now we are a 12A and
        80G certified NGO (that means if someone donates to NayePankh they will
        get a relief of 50%in income tax). The most striking feature about us is
        that we are completely led by the youths of our country, many of whom
        are still in their colleges and schools. We are on a mission to make
        this earth a better place to live for all creatures. We are here as
        'BADALTE BHARAT KI NAYI TASVEER'!!
